    //*Use assignment example for a model.
//*Do not use the same class and variables as the example.

//Create a project overloaded.

//Create a class that has
//• 4 instance variables
//• 3 overloaded constructors.
//o a default constructor
//o a constructor with 1 parameter
//o a constructor with at least 3 parameters
//• getter and setter methods
//• at least 1 overloaded method

//2. Create a Main class with main() method that
//• creates 3 instances of the class above
//o using each of the 3 constructors
//• uses 1 of the instances to
//• calls both the overloaded methods
//• and prints out the returned values of the methods (or the value returned by other methods
//if these methods return void—see the setHealth() & getHealth() methods in the
//assignment example).
